                  Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is
                  an extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich
                  history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state
                  you want to be sure not to miss. As your journey is going to
                  be a long one, you had best be prepared for an arduous trek.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European
                  settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also
                  home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super
                  sturdy backpack from for your 3-month expedition.

                  There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in
                  springtime New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it was in
                  the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its
                  neighbors to the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.

                  You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make
                  sense to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the
                  best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly
                  hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in
                  Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to
                  keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may
                  be confronted by while passing through the Appalachians. These
                  boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.

                  This is where modern power generators were born as well as
                  contemporary means of transmitting energy. So we figured this

                  although it can be from time to time, is another town worth
                  passing through for several different reasons. While it might

                <p>
                  The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't
                  already guessed, can be summed up by using one delicious word:
                  chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most
                  likely, one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark on
                  during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar
                  A white house and several trees stand at the base showing the
                  immense scale." in the National Wildlife Refuge on your way to
                  Erie and have an extra eerie time!

                  From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline of
                  Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are
                  surprisingly common in this particular region of North
                  America, over 200 of which have registered with a magnitude of
                  2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only
                  thing shaking this centrally located state. One of the
                  country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting
                  to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be
                  one of the most thrilling quests you'll ever complete
                  (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to
                  ride as many roller coasters as you can before continue your
                  bike ride!

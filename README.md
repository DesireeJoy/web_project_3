# Project 3: From Portland to Portland with Yandex Bootcamp

## Overview
Use a figma based design brief and create a responsive design based on it. 
I used flex, grid and media queries to achieve these goals

### Example

```bash
@media only screen and (min-device-width: 320px) and (max-device-width: 767px) {
  .places__content {
    grid-template-columns: auto;
    grid-template-rows: repeat(3, auto);
    grid-column-gap: 0;
    grid-row-gap: 48px;
  }
}
```
